To assess performance aspects of storm, we currently use the prism benchmark suite and the imca benchmarks for MAs. 
In order to share these results, we provide the results together with the log files on github.

{:.alert .alert-info}
The log files were obtained using a version of storm that represents "infinity" as "-1" in `--exact` mode. This is,
however just a displaying issue. Newer versions of storm correctly display "inf" as the result.
