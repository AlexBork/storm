# Use a Virtual Machine

## Storm 0.10 
We provide an outdated VM with pre-installed Storm 0.10 for historical reasons. The VM includes dependencies and other useful reference tools (like [PRISM](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/){:target="_blank"} and [IMCA](https://github.com/buschko/imca){:target="_blank"} and the PRISM benchmark suite) on a Linux host system. You can download the virtual machine [here](https://rwth-aachen.sciebo.de/index.php/s/nthEAQL4o49zkYp){:target="_blank"}.

{:.alert .alert-danger}
Note that the provided virtual machine images is outdated. We recommend to use the [Docker container](docker.html){:.alert-link} instead.

{:.alert .alert-info}
The virtual machine is hosted at [sciebo](https://www.sciebo.de/en/){:target="_blank" .alert-link}, an academic cloud hoster.

### Importing

When you have downloaded the OVA image, you can import it into, for example, [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org){:target="_blank"}. Before the first run, you should review the hardware resources allocated to the VM. E.g., for VirtualBox open *Settings â†’ System* and adjust the memory size and CPU count under *Motherboard* and *Processor*, respectively.

The username and password are both *storm* and a `README` file is provided on the desktop. In the virtual machine, Storm is located at `/home/storm/storm` and the binaries can be found in `/home/storm/storm/build/bin`. For your convenience, an environment variable with the name `STORM_DIR` is set to the path containing the binaries and this directory is added to the `PATH`, meaning that you can run the Storm binaries from any location in the terminal and that
```console
$ cd $STORM_DIR
```
will take you to the folders containing Storm's binaries. For more information on how to run Storm, please read our [guide]({{ site.github.url }}/documentation/usage/running-storm.html).
