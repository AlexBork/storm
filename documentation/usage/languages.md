# Prism

The prismm language can be used to specify DTMCs, MDPs and CTMCs. A simple extension to support the declaration for MA is supported. 

For more information, please read the [prism-manual](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/manual/ThePRISMLanguage/Introduction).
A rich collection of examples is available at the [prism benchmark suite]().

# Jani

Jani models define DTMCs, MDPs, CTMCs or MA.

For more information, please visit the [jani-specification](http://www.jani-spec.org), where you can also find some [examples](https://github.com/ahartmanns/jani-models/)

# GSPNs

[Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets](#) can be given in either of two formats. For both formats [examples](#) are available.
