We are happy to announce the next stable release of Storm in version 1.5.0.
<!--more-->

The most notably feature in this release is the portfolio engine (`--engine portfolio`) which automatically picks goods settings based on the input file.
In addition, abort of Storm is now gracefully handled and outputs the result computed so far.
Optimistic value iteration for sound computations was added and is now the default algorithm.
For detailed information on all the changes, please check the [release notes](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm/releases/tag/1.5.0).
