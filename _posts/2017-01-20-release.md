We proudly announce the release of the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm).

This first public version of Storm is focused on the core functionality of Storm: Model checking Markov chains. It has been thoroughly tested on a variety of platforms. However, native tools tend to be sensitive to environment changes. We welcome every kind of [<i class="fa fa-envelope" aria-hidden="true"></i> feedback](mailto:storm-dev@i2.informatik.rwth-aachen.de) and hope that this will allow us to improve your experience with Storm.
