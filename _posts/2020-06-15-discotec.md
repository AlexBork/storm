We are giving an (online) tutorial on Storm at [DisCoTec 2020](https://www.discotec.org/2020/).
<!--more-->

The tutorial takes place on June, 15th, at 13:30 (CET+1) and will be held online.
We will give an introduction into probabilistic model checking with Storm.
We present the usage of Storm and the Python bindings stormpy by means of interactive examples.
For more information, see the website for [DisCoTec Tools](https://www.discotec.org/2020/tutorials#the-probabilistic-model-checker-storm).

If you want to follow along the interactive presentation, make sure to have followed the [Storm installation steps](https://www.discotec.org/2020/storm-tutorial) beforehand.
