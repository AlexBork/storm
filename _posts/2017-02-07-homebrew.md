To ease the installation of Storm, we now provide a [homebrew](https://brew.sh/){:target="_blank"} formula.
<!--more-->

Users of macOS can now install Storm with a just few commands using homebrew, "the missing package manager for macOS". For more information on how to use this installation method, please see our updated guide on [how to install Storm]({{ site.baseurl}}/documentation/installation/installation.html#homebrew).
