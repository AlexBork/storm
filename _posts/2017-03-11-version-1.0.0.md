As Storm is becoming more stable, we decided to take a leap and move Storm's version to 1.0.0.
<!--more-->

Following some bug fixes and other minor improvements, we decided Storm is ready to be published in a version that reflects it's maturity. We updated the homebrew formula, too, so users of homebrew are able to update Storm by

```shell
brew update
brew upgrade stormchecker
```
