Storm has a large number of dependencies which all contribute to the capabilities of storm. 
We would like to thank the developers of these tools (in lexicographic order):

- [Boost](http://www.boost.org), which we use for Just-in-Time compilation, parsing of the prism language & properties, as well as other tasks.
- [Carl](http://smtrat.github.io/carl/), which we use for symbolic computations and as a wrapper for exact arithmetic, and from which we took some cmake build scripts.
- [CLN](http://www.ginac.de/CLN/), which we use for exact number representation.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org), which we use for building storm.
- [Cudd](http://vlsi.colorado.edu/~fabio/CUDD/cudd.pdf), which we use as a backend for MTBDD based model checking.
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), which we use for solving linear equation systems.
- [Gmm++](http://download.gna.org/getfem/html/homepage/gmm/), which we use for solving linear equation systems.
- [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest), which we use for our testing infrastructure.
- [L3pp](https://github.com/hbruintjes/l3pp), which we use for logging.
- [Prism](http://www.prismmodelchecker.org), from which we took some CUDD extensions for MTBDD based model checking.
- [Sylvan](http://fmt.cs.utwente.nl/tools/sylvan/), which we use as a backend for MTBDD based model checking.
- [Xerces](https://xerces.apache.org), which we use for XML parsing.
- [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki), which we ue for smt solving.

We are happy to use the XCode, CLion, Valgrind, Git and Jenkins for development purposes.

Furthermore, we are grateful for the feedback we received by:

- Joachim Klein, TU Dresden
