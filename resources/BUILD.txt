CMake >= 2.8.11
 CMake is required as it is used to generate the Makefiles or Projects/Solutions required to build StoRM.

Prerequisites:
 Boost >= 1.54
	Build using the Boost Build system, for x64 use "bjam address-model=64" or "bjam.exe address-model=64 --build-type=complete"
	You may use --toolset to specify the compiler, for ex. msvc-10.0, intel11.1, etc
 Doxygen
	Set DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE to your doxygen executable, e.g. "C:/Program Files/doxygen/bin/doxygen.exe"
 GTest >= 1.7.0
	GTest is included in the StoRM Sources under /resources/3rdparty/gtest-1.7.0 and builds automatically alongside StoRM
 CUDD >= 2.5.0
	CUDD is included in the StoRM Sources under /resources/3rdparty/cudd-2.5.0 and builds automatically alongside StoRM. 
	Its Sourced where heavily modified as to incorporate newer Versions of Boost, changes in C++ (TR1 to C++11) and
	to remove components only available under UNIX.
 Log4CPlus >= 1.1.2
	Log4CPlus is included in the StoRM Sources under /resources/3rdparty/log4cplus-1.1.3-rc1 and builds automatically alongside StoRM. 
	Its Sourced where slightly modified as to incorporate Unicode handling under Win32, Clang compatability and shared/static build options.
 Eigen >= 3.2.1
	Eigen is included in the StoRM Sources under /resources/3rdparty/eigen and builds automatically alongside StoRM.
 GMM >= 4.2
	GMM is included in the StoRM Sources under /resources/3rdparty/gmm-4.2 and builds automatically alongside StoRM.
 LTL2DStar >= 0.5.1
	LTL2DStar is included in the StoRM Sources under /resources/3rdparty/ltl2dstar-0.5.1 and builds automatically alongside StoRM. 
	Its Sourced where heavily modified as to incorporate changes in C++ (TR1 to C++11) and
	to remove components only available under UNIX.

Optional:
 Gurobi >= 5.5.0
	Specify the path to the gurobi root dir using -DGUROBI_ROOT=/your/path/to/gurobi
 Z3 >= 4.3.2
	Specify the path to the z3 root dir using -DZ3_ROOT=/your/path/to/z3
	
It is recommended to make an out-of-source build, meaning that the folder in which CMake generates its Cache, Makefiles and output files should not be the Project Root nor its Source Directory.
A typical build layout is to create a folder "build" in the project root alongside the CMakeLists.txt file, change into this folder and execute "cmake .." as this will leave all source files untouched
and makes cleaning up the build tree very easy.
There are several options available for the CMake Script as to control behaviour and included components.
If no error occured during the last CMake Configure round, press Generate. 
Now you can build StoRM using the generated project/makefiles in the Build folder you selected.
