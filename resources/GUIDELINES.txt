/* ---------------------------------- GUIDELINES FOR MRMC DEVELOPMENT ---------------------------------- */

In general, we adhere to the Google Styleguide for C++, found under http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml

 - C++ file names are <class>.h and <class>.cpp
 - all Source Code is to reside in the src/ Directory or an appropriate subdirectory, apart from Third-Party Librarys and modules stored under resources/
 - all Source Code is to be documented using DoxyGen Syntax:

	/*! \brief A chess piece
	 * The abstract parent of all chess pieces. */

	class ChessPiece {
		/*! Whether we've moved */
		bool bMoved;

		/*! Move to P(x, y)
		 * \param x The x coordinate
		 * \param y The y coordinate
		 * \return Whether the move was legal */
		bool bMove(int x, int y);
	}
 - opening brackets on the same line: if (true) {
 - always use brackets for "if", "while", "for" and the like, even if it is a one-liner
 - use Common Sense
